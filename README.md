<h1>Bamazon</h1>

<h3>An Amazon-like shopping program</h3>

---

Overview

In this project, I created an Amazon-like storefront with  MySQL. The app takes in orders from customers and depletes stock from the store's inventory.

Please install npm packages by typing the following commands:

`npm install mysql`
`npm install inquirer`
`npm install cli-table`

Start the program by:

`node bamazon.js` 

to see available products and purchase 

Exit this program anytime by pressing 

`control + c`
